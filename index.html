                Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels
                chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley,
                all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns
                Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the
                wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical
            <img src="img/co47.jpg" alt="" class="leftfloat">
            people). Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June
                1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They
                have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of
                modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies
                worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty
            languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
                with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million
                copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release. The series was originally published
                in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions
                around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[4] A play, <img src="img/co43.jpg" alt="" class="leftfloat">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,
                based on a story co-written by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and
                its script was published by<img src="img/co50.jpg" alt="" class="rightfloat"> Little, Brown. The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part
                namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is the third-highest-grossing film series of all
                time as of February 2020. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25
                billion,[5] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. A series of
                many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes
                elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores
                numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[6] According to Rowling, the main
                <img src="img/co40.jpg" alt="" class="rightfloat">
            <img src="img/co52.jpg" alt="" class="leftfloat">
            theme is death.[7] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[8] The
                success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative
                works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in
                2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and
                a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,
                among many other developments. Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding
                World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the
                world.

                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released in the United States, India and the Philippines as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, based on J. K. Rowling's 1997 novel of the same name. Produced by David Heyman and screenplay by Steve Kloves, it is the first instalment of the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his formal wizarding education. Warner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million).Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a shortlist of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, with the three leads chosen in August 2000 following open casting calls. The film was shot at Leavesden Film Studios and historic buildings around the United Kingdom, from September 2000 to March 2001. The film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 10 and 11 November 2001 for two days of previews. It opened on 16 November in the United States, Canada and Taiwan as well as officially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974 million at the box office worldwide during its initial run, and over $1 billion with subsequent re-releases. It became the highest-grossing film of 2001 and the second-highest-grossing film at the time. The film was nominated for many awards, including Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It was followed by seven sequels, beginning with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002 and ending with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011, nearly ten years after the first film's release.
